I will describe the situation to you, and you can help me unpack it.  We will need the frontend designer skill for much of our work.

We will be discussing changes to the User pages; specifically the My Personas page.

First of all, the pages already have "edit persona" modals, but the page is hideous and I can't even read anything it renders.  But I imagine we'll be changing it anyway.  ALso, the "explore personas" page for a logged-in user shoul be different from the "Personas" page that a visitor sees rendered.  The logged-in user's "Explore Personas" page (which is accessible from the dashboard) should be a list of the available personas, along with a brief desctiption of how they generally behave.  This explanation will be a brief explanation informed by the layer 1 persona prompts (as reformated by some inference process).  On this page, users can "Add to Contacts", which adds the personas to the users own persona contacts, and causes those personas to show up in the User's "My Personas" page.

As mentioned, the My Personas page is in a sorry state, but we need it to change it to be as described below:

The My Personas page lists the user's personas.  This is also where users should be able to view and edit layer 3 (Relationship context) and layer 4 (User knowledge) in the same way that the Admin Persona Designer can set these from their dashboard.  Each persona in the User's contacts should have this data available and editable (perhaps an expandable/collapsable form or a modal.  Probably a modal for the User's My Personas page, what do you think frontend designer?).  

For the relatinship contexts, we should have some preconfigured options as we do on the Admin version, and depending on the type of relationship, personas will receive admin-designed relationship context prompts in the background when the user gets calls from the persona (is this making sense, and is this a good way to do it>).  The context can be modified with LIMITED text from user (less than 200 characters probably).

Layer 4, User facts, should also be accessible and editable from this modal/expanded menu on the My Personas page for the persona.  The My Personas page should be tidy and neat, as the Admin's Persona Designer is, but be larger in fonts so as to be more accessible than the admin version (since we'll have all ages and abilities of user).

Ok, that's probably enough for now.  Let's talk about it, and then decide if this is a good next priority, or if we need to defer for another PX priority.

==========
Good overview! Let me unpack this and give you my thoughts:

  What You're Describing

  Two User Pages:
  1. Explore Personas (logged-in version) - Browse available personas, "Add to Contacts"
  2. My Personas - User's personal contacts with Layer 3/4 editing

  Layer System Recap:
  - Layer 1 - Core persona personality (admin-set, shown as description on Explore)
  - Layer 3 - Relationship context (preconfigured options + limited user customization)
  - Layer 4 - User facts/knowledge (user-editable)

  My Thoughts

  The Architecture Makes Sense

  Yes, having relationship presets that inject admin-designed prompts behind the scenes is smart -
   users pick "Life Coach" or "Supportive Friend" and get well-crafted context without having to
  write prompts. The 200-char user addition is a good constraint.

  Modal vs Expandable?

  For My Personas, I'd suggest:
  - Modal - cleaner UX, prevents page from becoming cluttered
  - Cards show persona name + relationship type + quick actions
  - Click card → Modal with Layer 3/4 editing
  - Larger fonts, accessibility-focused as you mentioned
