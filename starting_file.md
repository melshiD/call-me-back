This document will provide the instructions for begining this session.  Follow them, and report back to the user as requested.  If you hae questions feel free to ask.

Read PCR.md and review.  This knowledge will aid with understaning how to build for this app.

Then read MIDTERM_EXAMINATION.md, which will give context on where we were recently with our progress in the hackathon and where we need to focus efforts.  It's a thoughtful analysis, and will give guidance on deployments, debugging, and the general gotchas of building for this stack.

MIDTERM_EXAMINATION.md is a living document, and has undergone changes at scheduled times.

We are far enough along since MIDTERM_EXAMINATION took place that I think it's time to construct a new type of PCR.md doument.

The PCR or Project Context Review was designed to provide a number of resources to Claude Code, not limited to:
- Information on working design patterns
- Where to find information on a specific subject in order to keep Claude in-context with certain subjects that tend to go in circles or confuse.
- How to properly deploy with certain frameworks or certain tech
- Steps that must be taken when performing various deployment tasks
- Condensed takeaways from significant debuggins sessions and breakthroughs
- Maintain the understanding that this project is for the AI Champion Ship hackathon by Devpost
- **Information on where to find our additional documentation on**
    - Current work/current debuggin tasks
    - Debugging plans
    - Pricing stragety and plans
    - Structured ideas for future features or tech
    - Notes on how we do or should use hackathon required tech in our stack
    - Info to return to regarding hackathon partners and requirements

After following the instructions and reading the documentation, I'd like you to provide a throrough, new PCR2.md, that not only provides the valuable and necessary information that has guided us this far, but also is updated to bring the document to the current, full reality of the project (we should be able to remove MIDTERM_EXAMINATION.md from the required reading list once our new PCR2.md is ready).  The new PCR2.md will serve the original purpose of PCR.md, but include all of the new info learned since we first created PCR.md.  PRC2.md will reflect the full status of the project, enshrine knowledge that has remained constant and useful, and close with guidance on where to find details on specific tasks.

(For your records, Our last work together was MCP_DEBUGGING_SESSION_2025-11-19.md)

That is all.  Please report back to the user once you have read and understood this instruction set.  Thank you, and let's do good, speedy and accurate work!
