Is it required to use all 4 Raindrop features mentioned in the Hackathon reqs, or can we just use what we need (and what works!)

Is there some way to get the ElevenLabs STT to work with Cloudflare Workers?

Am I required to implement WorkOS for auth? (I Have it, but I think it's falling back to JWT)
