I want to build a frontend for my application using Vue. The app should include:

- User authentication (login/register/logout)
- Provide a scheduler so users can schedule calls
- Build a "list of contacts" which are designed AI personas
- An interface to design personas or search existing personas (for adding to contacts/ available bots to be called by)
- User profile management
  - Billing/Usage


IMPORTANT: Do NOT implement any actual backend or API calls. Instead, for every place where I would need an API call, leave detailed comments that specify:
- The exact API endpoint URL and HTTP method
- Request headers needed
- Request body structure with types
- Expected response structure with status codes
- Error response formats

Make the UI fully functional with mock data so I can interact with it, but ensure every backend interaction point is clearly documented with the API specifications above.
